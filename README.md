# Curve-Tracer

This curve tracer project is meant to end up as a fully functional, DC powered, but low voltage semiconductor characterizing instrument.
I started working on the project at the Petnica science center during the 2023 winter electronics seminar, but will continue working on it and updating it irregardless of the seminar.
If all goes according to plan the curve tracer will only use basic componenets such as opamps, transistors, diodes, inductors, capacitors, and resistors, excluding the DC PSU and the microcontroller.
A detailed timeline with updates can be found in the Progress Log folder, some of the updates on it will be done retroactivel.
